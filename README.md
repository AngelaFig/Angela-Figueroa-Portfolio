## Description

https://angelafig.github.io/Angela-Figueroa-Portfolio/

This project is a professional portfolio that contains information about me, Angela Mariana Figueroa, the developer, including a brief bio, contact information, and links to my deployed applications.  This portfolio is a platform that I will use to showcase my work and talents to future employers that are looking to fill positions.  As I grow as a developer, I will continue to add content to this page and I will continue to improve styling as I learn new techniques to do so.  

<!-- Note: I have struggled with adding flexbox correctly.  I have also struggled with making the site responsive.  My media queries need to be adjusted-->
