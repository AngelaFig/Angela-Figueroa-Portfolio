# <Angela-Mariana-Figueroa-Portfolio>

## Description

https://angelafig.github.io/Angela-Figueroa-Portfolio/

This project is a professional portfolio that contains information about me, Angela Mariana Figueroa, the developer, including a brief bio, contact information, and links to my deployed applications.  This portfolio is a platform that I will use to showcase my work and talents to future employers that are looking to fill positions.  As I grow as a developer, I will continue to add content to this page and I will continue to improve styling as I learn new techniques to do so.  The site is responsive and will adjust to the viewport of any desktop, tablet, or mobile device an employer may view the site on.  

<!-- Note: I have struggled with adding flexbox correctly.  One will notice that my work image links are not in a row as I would like them to be. -->

## Usage


To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
